The Everton vs Liverpool live stream is an absolute must-watch as the Reds look to extend their advantage at the top of the Premier League by securing a victory in the rescheduled Merseyside derby

Everton may have been knocked out of the FA Cup at the weekend but the Toffees have been in excellent form in the league. David Moyes has had an instant impact, leading his side to three consecutive league victories, scoring eight goals in the process and conceding just twice. They‚Äôll be desperate to make it four in a row and can expect an electric atmosphere as they face the Reds for the last time at Goodison Park before moving to their new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock next season.

Liverpool also crashed out of the FA Cup after suffering a shock defeat to Championship strugglers Plymouth Argyle, but manager Arne Slot made wholesale changes and will bring his big-hitters back in for a crunch game. However, the Dutch boss will be aware of just how tough this game will be as the Reds‚Äô 2-0 loss in this exact fixture last season ended a 12-game unbeaten away run in the Premier League against Everton.

Engaged in their rescheduled game from matchday 15, the Reds will be looking to bounce back after they were shocked to an FA Cup exit by Plymouth Argyle.

The Toffees also suffered a defeat in the fourth round of the cup competition as they went down 2-0 against Bournemouth over the weekend.

Everton team news

Manager David Moyes is not expected to make many rotations from the game against Bournemouth. Vitalii Mykolenko could shake off a calf strain to start ahead of Ashley Young at left-back, with Jack Harrison in line to replace Jesper Lindstrom on the right flank. Beto will continue in attack.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Armando Broja, Youssef Chermiti and Dwight McNeil all remain sidelined.

Liverpool team news

Reds boss Arne Slot will make wholesale changes from the Plymouth loss and could revert to the side that beat Tottenham 4-0 in last Thursday's EFL Cup semi-final second-leg tie.

The likes of Diogo Jota, Harvey Elliott and Federico Chiesa would all drop out of the XI, but Luis Diaz should retain his spot as he partook in the FA Cup game.

Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo and Virgil van Dijk will all return to the XI, while Trent Alexander-Arnold, Tyler Morton and Joe Gomez are ruled out.

The Reds aims to widen their lead over Arsenal to nine points in the Premier League standings, while Everton seeks a victory to distance themselves by a comfortable 12 points from the relegation zone.

Despite the significant 15-place and 30-point gap between the two sides in the league table, the historical intensity of the derby often renders such disparities irrelevant. Liverpool enters the match with impressive momentum, having gone undefeated in their previous 19 league games, securing 14 wins and five draws.

Since David Moyes' return to Everton, the team has experienced a notable resurgence, clinching three victories in the five games under his leadership. After a narrow 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa, Everton bounced back with wins against Tottenham, Brighton and Leicester.
